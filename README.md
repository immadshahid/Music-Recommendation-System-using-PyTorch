# Overview
This is a music recommendation model similar to Spotivibe developed entirely using Pytorch. Extraction of the audio files was done using MFCC, Spectral Centroid and Zero crossing rate. A small dataset consisting of 63,000 audio files named "fma_small" was used. A recommedation model was trained on the extracted features using Pytorch and the phenomenon of deep learning.

# Approach
1) Normal and Features extraction was done using MFCC, Spectral Centroid and Zero crossing rate. <br>
2) Recommendation Model was trained by using the phenomenon of deep learning using Pytorch. <br>
